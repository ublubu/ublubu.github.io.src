I worked at Yahoo for just over a year on the digital magazines (platform) team.
I wrote JavaScript (with React) for the nodejs server and the web client.

[Yahoo Style](http://www.yahoo.com/style),
[Yahoo Food](http://www.yahoo.com/food),
[Yahoo Tech](http://www.yahoo.com/tech),
[Yahoo Beauty](http://www.yahoo.com/beauty),
[etc](http://www.yahoo.com/movies)

I focused on applying principles from functional programming to simplify complex code and create design patterns to encourage modularity and reduce avenues for bugs.
For example, when we converted our app to React and then Flux, I developed a pattern for managing and using state - inspired by functional reactive programming like Elm and elerea and flow graphs like Intel TBB and React itself.
I wrote [this tumblr blog post](http://ublubu.tumblr.com/post/109544244542/a-reactive-perspective-on-flux)^1^ about the Flux store aspect after using the pattern for a few months.
