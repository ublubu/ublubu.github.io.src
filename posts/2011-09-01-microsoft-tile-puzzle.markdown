I co-created the Tile Puzzle app with Michael Montazeri using HTML5 and JavaScript for Windows 8. I was invited to //build/ as a panelist for a discussion about the Windows 8 app development experience but was unable to attend.

The app itself was based on the 15-puzzle, but we made it special by supporting video, slideshows, and webcam as the puzzle visuals. It's quite a different game when the pictures on the tiles are constantly changing.
