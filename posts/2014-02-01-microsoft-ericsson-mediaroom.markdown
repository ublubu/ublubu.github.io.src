I developed an automated reporting system for our big data platform (Azure, C#, Hadoop). Recurring and ad-hoc reports were defined in a format designed to work behind a simple form-based UI. My system read these definitions from SQL and generated Oozie jobs and Hive scripts to create the reports and upload them to SQL. I also did some work with recommendations.
