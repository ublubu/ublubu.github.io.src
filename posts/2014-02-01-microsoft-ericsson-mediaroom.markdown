I developed an automated system for user-configured reports on our big data platform (Azure, C#, Hadoop).
It allowed non-technical users, including Mediaroom clients, to safely configure, generate, and view reports using a variety of data sources, metrics, and drill-downs.
The system also allowed us to support new data formats without code changes or redeployment.

I wrote and owned a large portion of the system, including the code for managing our SQL and Hive databases, compiling report configurations to Hive, and everything else between reading a report configuration, parsing and processing logs, and uploading the result.

I also wrote a metadata-comparing recommendations feature called "More Like This" that we used in the TV product.
I experimented with a more complex algorithm using feature vectors obtained from user ratings, but I left the company before I could investigate recommendations further.
