title: 2D Physics in Haskell
postType: project

Here's a constraint-based physics engine I'm writing in Haskell. It's based on GDC slide decks I found online.
I've always been curious about game development. I also wanted to write some Haskell to run in real-time.

I'm looking forward to using this codebase as a playground for learning about profiling and optimizing Haskell. I would also like to explore more exotic approaches - I've heard great things about writing languages/compilers in Haskell.
