title: Web App Development with GHCJS and reflex-dom
postType: project
---

I'm working on finding client-side best practices for developing modern web apps in Haskell, specifically using reflex-dom, a new functional reactive programming (FRP) library for browser-side apps.

Here's a post about [client-side routing as a microcosm of client-side app architecture in general](https://ublubu.tumblr.com/post/144208331227/client-side-routing-in-reflex-dom-notes-1).

Server-side I'm using servant, persistent, esqueleto, cookie, and clientsession.
