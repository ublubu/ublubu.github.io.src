title: Haskell Project for LeapYear.io
postType: project

I did a small Haskell project for LeapYear.io where I implemented a streaming database interface and blocked streaming joins and converted a differentially private machine learning algorithm from an in-memory implementation to a streaming version.

I used pipes and pipes-group for streaming, HDBC for database access, and criterion and HUnit for benchmarking and testing.
