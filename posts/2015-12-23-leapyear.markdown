I worked a consulting job for LeapYear where I implemented streaming versions of some of their differentially private machine learning algorithms.
Previously, these algorithms were limited to datasets that fit in memory.
My implementations made it possible to process datasets of any size.

I used pipes and pipes-group for streaming, HDBC for database access, and criterion and HUnit for benchmarking and testing.
