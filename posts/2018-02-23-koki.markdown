I built a CI system (inspired by Drone) that runs user-defined pipelines of containerized (Docker) tasks.
It installs with a single `kubectl` command and integrates with both GitHub and Bitbucket repositories.
I also developed an embedded DSL for defining more complex container pipelines in Haskell.

I built the first automated installer for Hyperledger Fabric (blockchain platform) on Kubernetes.
Pre-existing techniques required that users manually reconfigure each worker node in their Kubernetes cluster
(a workaround for `kube-dns`), but I found that Docker-in-Docker obviates this need.

We also created [koki/short](https://github.com/koki/short), a compact file format for Kubernetes manifests.
One major feature is the [modules system](https://docs.koki.io/short/modules/) that I added.
