title: Waze Carpool iOS Team (Aug 2016 - Oct 2017)
postType: job

I worked on the Waze Rider iOS app for Waze Carpool at Google.
I used mostly Objective-C and some Swift.

In addition to feature work, I also worked on our build, release, and monitoring automation
and refactoring our codebase for better maintenance, testing, and sharing of code.
